```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This is an initial report describing changes in life expectancy over the past 60 years as it relates to GDP, country and continent. The data were taken from gapminder dataset. 


```{r load_data, echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

The gapminder dataset contains `r ncol(gapminder)` variables from `r nrow(gapminder)` observations. It's clear that civil wars and HIV/AIDS have had a major impact on life expectancy in Africa.

```{r facet_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.path="figure/"}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + geom_point() +
facet_grid(.~continent)
```
